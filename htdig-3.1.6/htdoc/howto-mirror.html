    Since ht://Dig is gaining popularity, it's good the project gets mirrored.
    Mirroring is of vital importance for improved availability, reponse time and of
    course, to save bandwidth for the
    main server. This document is about how to mirror all or a part of the
    ht://Dig web and FTP sites. Make sure you read it all.<p>There are four
    sites you can mirror:
    <ol>
      <li>The ht://Dig web site (main and development)</li>
      <li>The ht://Dig files web site (formerly reachable by FTP)</li>
      <li>The ht://Dig patch FTP site</li>
      <li>The source code development trees (also known as CVS repository)</li>
    </ol>
    Note: since november 2001, SourceForge has stopped hosting project FTP services.

    <h5>Some Words about CVS and Wget</h5>
    <p class="main">
    Developing source code with possibly a large number of contributors spread around the world
    is a tedious task and requires good coordination. This coordination is provided by a piece
    of software known as Concurrent Versions System (CVS). This is why we use CVS for
    software development. But the web site is frequently updated by developers too; text
    is added, changed or deleted, new pages created etc. For the same reasons as developing
    software, we placed the web site in a CVS <i>repository</i>.
    More information on CVS can be found in the <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/">CVS online
    documentation</a>. Note: There are a <i>lot</i> of options for use with CVS, which are not explained here.
    It's merely a short howto on how to set up a local mirror of the ht://Dig project. You should use
    version 1.10 or higher.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
    Wget is a software package that enables you create a mirror (an exact copy of) a FTP or web site. It
    is published under GNU license and should run on virtually every platform. If you don't like Wget,
    you can try Mirror, which is a very good alternative for mirrorring FTP sites.
    To learn more on wget, see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/wget.html">Wget web site</a>.
    You should use version 1.7 or higher.</p>
    <p class="main">
    Alas, SourceForge does not provide an Rsync service and as far as we know, they are not intend to.</p>

<br>
    
    <h5>Some Notes Before We Begin (in no specific order)</h5>
    <p class="main">
    <ul>
      <li>For now, this is a Un*x howto only. CVS is known to works on NT/2000, but we have no reports
      that Wget runs on those machines. Maybe later, things concerning W*nd*ws will be added.</li>
      <li>We use U*nix notation of commands, like <code>cvs(1)</code> where <code>(1)</code> means that
      information can be found in section one of the man pages.
      <li>The development pages are no longer on their own; they are combined with the main web site.</li>
      <li>We assume you have a up-and-running web server like <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>.</li>
      <li>We assume you have a up-and-running FTP server like <a href="http://www.wu-ftpd.org/">Wu-FTPd</a>.
      Anonymous FTP access is chroot-ed (change-rooted). Forget it if you don't know what
      we're talking about.</li>
      <li>To fully implement a mirror you'll need to activate server side includes on your web server.
      Your system administrator knows more. See the examples at the end.</li>
      <li>If you've mirrored the ht://Dig patch FTP site, you can make these files visible on your web server
      by setting an Alias in your web server configuration file, and you'll need to activate directory
      indexing. See the examples at the end.</li>
      <li>As a mirror, you are expected to update at least once a day--with the exception of new releases,
      daily changes are usually very small.
      <li>We'll make use of a fictitious domain named <code>htdigmirror.org</code>. The WWW document
      root is <code>/home/htdigmirror/www/</code>
      <li>Please make sure that you interprete the commands presented here well. Some commands are
      long and browsers tend to break it in two or three pieces.
      <li>After setting up your mirror, please e-mail 
      &lt;<a href="mailto:htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net">htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;
      to notify the developers. If you're not on the developers list, you will get an e-mail
      stating that your message is queued for moderation. Eventually it will be delivered
      to the list.</li>
      <li>This is just <i>a</i> way of implementing a mirror. You can surely come up with good
      alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
<br>

    <h5>Setting up a Copy of the ht://Dig website</h5>


    <i>Step 1</i><br>
    <blockquote>
    You need to have <code>cvs(1)</code> installed on your system. It will not work without. Check out:<br>
      <blockquote><code>man&nbsp;cvs</code></blockquote>
    If your don't have it on your box, ask the administrator to install it for you.</blockquote>
    
    
    <br>
    <i>Step 2</i><br>
    <blockquote>You'll need to gain anonymous access at the CVS repository.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cvs&nbsp;-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.htdig.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/htdig&nbsp;login
      </code></blockquote>
    When asked for a password, leave it blank (i.e. press the enter key). You only need to do this
    once since <code>cvs(1)</code> will create a CVS password file <code>.cvspass</code> in your home
    directory that will be used in future invocations.</blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 3</i><br>
    <blockquote>Create a directory where you will place your local copy. You can
    pick any legal name you want, but for the sake of simplicity we'll name
    the directory <code>htdig</code>. Note that the <code>cvs(1)</code> command later on will
    create another directory under the just created <code>htdig</code> directory.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cd&nbsp;/home/htdigmirror/www/<br>
        mkdir&nbsp;htdig
      </code></blockquote>
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 4</i><br>
    <blockquote>Change to that directory.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cd&nbsp;htdig
      </code></blockquote>
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 5</i><br>
    <blockquote>Check out the htdig module. In newbie-speak: create a local copy of the ht://Dig web site.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cvs&nbsp;-z6&nbsp;-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.htdig.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/htdig&nbsp;\<br>
        co&nbsp;-d&nbsp;maindocs&nbsp;maindocs
      </code></blockquote>
    (Note the backslash at the end of the first line of the command. In Un*x this is the <i>concatenation metacharacter</i>,
    which means that the two code lines should read as one.)
    So what does the line of code mean? We are accessing the ht://Dig repository at
    <code>cvs.htdig.sourceforge.net</code> in directory <code>/cvsroot/htdig</code>
    via the <i>password server</i> (pserver) and checking out (co) module <i>maindocs</i>
    using <code>gzip(1)</code> compression (-z6) and place it in a local directory
    called <code>maindocs</code>. We could have left out the <code>-d maindocs</code>
    as this is the default. You will see some output on your terminal.
    The <code>cvs(1)</code> command has created a sub directory named <code>maindocs</code>.
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 6</i><br>
    <blockquote>Now you need to adapt your web server configuration file. Mabye your need superuser privileges to
    do that. Don't forget to turn on server side includes (SSI). At the end there's an example configuration file
    for use with Apache <i>virtual hosts</i>. Start your favorite browser and surf to the web page. It should be
    something like
      <a href="http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/maindocs/">http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/maindocs/</a>.
    You did restart your web server, didn't you?
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 7</i><br>
    <blockquote>Ready. You've set up a mirror! Please inform the developers
    at &lt;<a href="mailto:htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net">htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;
    about your mirror.</blockquote>
<br>

    <h5>Updating Your Local Copy of the ht:/Dig Web Site</h5>

    <i>Step 1</i><br>
    <blockquote>You already have <code>cvs(1)</code> otherwise you couldn't have created the initial
    copy in the first place.</blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 2</i><br>
    <blockquote>You already have anonymous CVS access.</blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 3</i><br>
    <blockquote>Change to the directory that holds the copy of the ht://Dig web site<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cd&nbsp;/home/htdigmirror/www/htdig/maindocs
      </code></blockquote>
    Note that you have to <code>cd(1)</code> to the directory created by <code>cvs(1)</code>!</blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 4</i><br>
    <blockquote>Start the update by executing<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cvs&nbsp;-z6&nbsp;-q&nbsp;update&nbsp;-Pd
      </code></blockquote>
    You will see rows with updated files. If there's nothing to update, you
    will see a new command prompt only; there is no output.</blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 5</i><br>
    <blockquote>So you've updated your local copy of the ht://dig web site, but you don't
    want to do that every day. Solution: Set up a <code>crontab(1)</code> entry to update your mirror every day.
    Example of an entry:<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        40&nbsp;2&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/htdigmirror/www/htdig/maindocs&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;/usr/bin/cvs&nbsp;\
        -z6&nbsp;-q&nbsp;update&nbsp;-Pd
      </code></blockquote>
    This will run the command every 2:40 AM. Depending on your version of <code>cron(8)</code>,
    you will get a e-mail message containing the output of the command ran. If you do not want
    any output, you could use<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        40&nbsp;2&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;(cd&nbsp;/home/htdigmirror/www/htdig/maindocs&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;/usr/bin/cvs&nbsp;\
        -z6&nbsp;-q&nbsp;update&nbsp;-Pd)&nbsp;&gt;/dev/null&nbsp;2&gt;&amp;1
      </code></blockquote>
    It should work on <code>sh(1)</code> oriented shells.
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 6</i><br>
    <blockquote>Ready. Please inform the developers
    at &lt;<a href="mailto:htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net">htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;
    about your mirror.</blockquote>
<br>


    <h5>Setting up a Mirror of the ht://Dig Files Web Site</h5>
    

    <p class="main">
    In the early days (hmm, not so early for that matter), there was an ht://Dig FTP site that housed
    release tarballs, binaries, snapshots and contributed work. The FTP service is abandoned but fortunately,
    you can access them via the web; the <a href="http://www.htdig.org/files/">/files</a> directory. Since
    it's web access, <code>wget(1)</code> is used for retrieval. Note that you cannot copy the files directory
    via cvs and that there is no real files directory on the ht://Dig Web Site.</p>

    <i>Step 1</i>
    <blockquote>Make sure you have installed <code>wget(1)</code> and read the documentation.
    We're going to place the copy of the files into the anonymous FTP area. That way, you can
    have people access the files by FTP and by web.
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 2</i><br>
    <blockquote>Change to the public directory of the anonymous FTP area and create a sub directory
    for holding the files.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cd&nbsp;/home/ftp/pub<br>
        mkdir&nbsp;ftp.htdig.org<br>
        cd&nbsp;ftp.htdig.org<br>
      </code></blockquote>
    The files will be placed in the <i>files</i> directory (as you will see shortly).
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 3</i><br>
    <blockquote>Copy the files.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        wget&nbsp;-nv&nbsp;-m&nbsp;-np&nbsp;-nH&nbsp;-p&nbsp;http://www.htdig.org/files
      </code></blockquote>
    The -nv will turn off verbose output, but it will not be very quiet. The -m option tells <code>wget(1)</code> to
    turn on options suitable for mirroring (as in -r -N -l inf -nr). The -np (no-parent) option will prevent
    ascending to the parent directory. The option -nH disables generation of host-prefixed directories, so
    you will not get a directory called www.htdig.org. And last, -p causes <code>wget(1)</code> to download all the files that
    are necessary to properly display a given HTML page.<br>
    This combination of options will result in a directory called files that holds a copy of
    <a href="http://www.htdig.org/files/">http://www.htdig.org/files/</a>
    </blockquote>

    
    <br>
    <i>Step 4</i><br>
    <blockquote>
    There is one drawback; since the files directory at the ht://Dig web site holds no index.html file, the
    web server over there will create one on-the-fly. Even more, this generated file creates
    links to itself that will display the files in all kinds of sort order like name, last modified, size
    and description. (These links look like ?N=D, ?M=A etc.) We will have to remove them as they contain
    links calculated for the ht://Dig web site and will probably not match your copy.
    Also, the sites' robots.txt file is copied. We don't need it eighter. So we do
      <blockquote><code>
        rm&nbsp;-f&nbsp;robots.txt<br>
        cd&nbsp;files<br>
        find&nbsp;.&nbsp;-name&nbsp;index.html&nbsp;-print&nbsp;-exec&nbsp;rm&nbsp;-f&nbsp;{}&nbsp;\;<br>
        find&nbsp;.&nbsp;-name&nbsp;"*=*"&nbsp;-print&nbsp;-exec&nbsp;rm&nbsp;-f&nbsp;{}&nbsp;\;<br>
      </code></blockquote>
    (Note the double quotes round *=*!.) This will traverse the files directory and delete any index.html
    or ?N=D-like files. As a bonus, it will print out the files deleted.
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 5</i><br>
    <blockquote>Create an Alias in your web server configuration file so that
    this mirror can be accessed by web. We'll give an Alias line for Apache:<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        Alias&nbsp;/htdig/maindocs/files&nbsp;&quot;/home/ftp/pub/ftp.htdig.org/files&quot;
      </code></blockquote>
    Files should now be accessible via
    <a href="http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/maindocs/files/">http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/maindocs/files/</a>.
    Don't forget to turn on directory indexing!
    </blockquote>

    <br>
    <i>Step 6</i><br>
    <blockquote>Ready. Please inform the developers
    at &lt;<a href="mailto:htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net">htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;
    about your mirror.</blockquote>
<br>


    <h5>Updating your mirror of the ht://Dig Files Web Site</h5>
    <p class="main">
    This is very simple. Repeat step 2, 3 and 4 of "Setting up a Mirror of the ht://Dig Files Web Site". But
    there is one drawback (again). As <code>wget(1)</code> uses the links from the generated index.html files
    as pointers to other files to be fetched, it will leave files that are not in that index.html untouched.
    As a result, within a few weeks you will have a lot of snapshot files on your mirror and you'll need to
    remove them by hand.
    </p>
<br>

    
    <h5>Setting up a Mirror of the ht://Dig Patch Site</h5>
    
    <p class="main">
    Making a mirror of the patch site involves the use of <code>wget(1)</code> and is similar to creating a copy
    of the files web site.</p>

    <i>Step 1</i><br>
    <blockquote>Create a suitable direoctory in the anonymous FTP area.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cd&nbsp;/home/ftp/pub<br>
        mkdir&nbsp;ftp.ccsf.org<br>
        cd&nbsp;ftp.ccsf.org<br>
      </code></blockquote>
    Here we will place the files.
    </blockquote>


    <br>
    <i>Step 2</i><br>
    <blockquote>Copy the files.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        wget&nbsp;-nv&nbsp;-m&nbsp;-np&nbsp;-nH&nbsp;-p&nbsp;ftp://ftp.ccsf.org/htdig-patches
      </code></blockquote>
    This combination of options will result in a directory called htdig-patches that holds a copy of
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ccsf.org/htdig-patches">ftp://ftp.ccsf.org/htdig-patches</a>
    </blockquote>

    <br>
    <i>Step 3</i><br>
    <blockquote>
    For some reason, <code>wget(1)</code> leaves .listing files behind in your copy. Although they don't do any
    harm, it's nice to get rid of them.
      <blockquote><code>
        find&nbsp;.&nbsp;-name&nbsp;.listing&nbsp;-print&nbsp;-exec&nbsp;rm&nbsp;-f&nbsp;{}&nbsp;\;<br>
      </code></blockquote>
    This will traverse the htdig-patches directory and delete any .listing files. It will also delete the
    one in the top directory.
    </blockquote>

    <br>
    <i>Step 4</i><br>
    <blockquote>Create an Alias in your web server configuration file so that
    this mirror can be accessed by web. We'll give an Alias line for Apache:<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        Alias&nbsp;/htdig/maindocs/htdig-patches&nbsp;&quot;/home/ftp/pub/ftp.ccsf.org/htdig-patches&quot;
      </code></blockquote>
    Files should now be accessible via
    <a href="http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/maindocs/htdig-patches/">http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/maindocs/htdig-patches/</a>.
    Don't forget to turn on directory indexing!
    </blockquote>

    <br>
    <i>Step 6</i><br>
    <blockquote>Ready. Please inform the developers
    at &lt;<a href="mailto:htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net">htdig-dev@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;
    about your mirror.</blockquote>
<br>

    <h5>Updating your mirror of the ht://Dig Patch Web Site</h5>
    <p class="main">
    This is very simple. Repeat step 1, 2 and 3 of "Setting up a Mirror of the ht://Dig Patch Site".
    </p>
<br>


    <h5>Setting up a Copy of the Source Code Development Trees (CVS Repository)</h5>

    <p class="main">
    There are two trees you can checkout: the 3.1 branch and 3.2beta branch.
    Because you know the procedure now, we'll just give the commands.<br>
      <blockquote><code>
        cd&nbsp;/home/htdigmirror/www/htdig<br>
        cvs&nbsp;-z6&nbsp;-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.htdig.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/htdig&nbsp;\<br>
	co&nbsp;-d&nbsp;htdig-3-1-x&nbsp;-r&nbsp;htdig-3-1-x&nbsp;htdig<br>
        cvs&nbsp;-z6&nbsp;-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.htdig.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/htdig&nbsp;\<br>
	co&nbsp;-d&nbsp;htdig-3-2-x&nbsp;-r&nbsp;htdig-3-2-x&nbsp;htdig<br>
      </code></blockquote>
    <p class="main">
    (the -r option will checkout a specific <i>revision</i>). You'll get two subdirectories named
    <code>htdig-3-1-x</code> and <code>htdig-3-2-x</code> containing the CVS trees.
    The trees can be accessed through web via
    <a href="http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/htdig-3-1-x">http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/htdig-3-1-x/</a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/htdig-3-2-x">http://www.htdigmirror.org/htdig/htdig-3-2-x/</a>
    respectively.
    You'll need to adapt your web server configuration file so that it will show directory indexes.
    See examples at the end.
    </p>

    <p class="main">
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you leave out the -r option, you will check out
    the main branch of the htdig source tree, but this branch has been largely
    untouched since February 2000. You must use the -r option.
    </p>

    <p class="main">
    <strong>Note:</strong>There is currently no link from the ht://Dig Web Site to
    the CVS trees, so people cannot access it by your mirror. You have to tell them
    otherwise.
    </p>
<br>


    <h5>Updating the Copy of the Source Code Development Trees</h5>
    <p class="main">
    Well, this just like updating the ht://Dig web site. You'll need to goto the
    right directory and issue the <code>cvs(1)</code> update command.
    </p>
<br>


    <h5>E-mail addresses</h5>

    <ul>
    <li>Questions concerning the ht://Dig Web Site, the ht://Dig Files Site and the Source Code
    Development Trees can be addressed to Geoff Hutchison
    &lt;<a href="mailto:ghutchis@wso.williams.edu">ghutchis@wso.williams.edu</a>&gt;</li>
    <li>The ht://Dig Patch Site is maintained by Joe R. Jah
    &lt;<a href="mailto:jjah@cloud.ccsf.cc.ca.us">jjah@cloud.ccsf.cc.ca.us</a>&gt;</li>
    </ul>
<br>


    <h5>Further conciderations</h5>
    <p class="main">
    One can use <code>wget(1)</code> to copy the ht://Dig main web site, althought <code>cvs(1)</code> is surely
    efficiently and faster. If you decide to copy the ht://Dig main web site with <code>wget(1)</code>, note
    that you will make a copy of the /files directory automaticly. The /files directory is currently about
    70 MB.
