	  If you are having problems or have suggestions for ht://Dig feel
	  free to fill out a bug report form. Before you do this, please do
	  the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Make sure you have the latest version, always available
	  from <a href="where.html">multiple sources.</a>
	  You can also check the <a
	  href="http://www.htdig.org/RELEASE.html">release notes</a>
	  for what has changed in new versions.</li>
	  <li>Read the latest documentation, always available at
	  <a href="http://www.htdig.org/">http://www.htdig.org/</a></li>
	  <li>Read the FAQ, always available at
	  <a href="http://www.htdig.org/FAQ.html">http://www.htdig.org/FAQ.html</a></li>
	  <li>Looked at the log from running with more verbosity. Usually
	  "-vvv" is helpful for debugging information. Please include any
	  related messages and as much information about your configuration
	  as possible.</li>
	  <li>Checked the ht://Dig
	  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=104593&group_id=4593&func=browse">bug database</a>.</li>
	  <li>If the bug involves dumping a core file, it also helps
	  if you can provide debugging information from the core. If
	  you don't know how to do this, feel free to ask.</li>
         <li>Make sure that the problem you're encountering is indeed a
         bug and not just a problem with your configuration. If you are
         unsure of this, it's usually helpful to discuss the problem on
         the <a href="mailing.html">htdig-general mailing list</a> first.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	If you've done this, you can easily submit a bug report or a
	feature request through the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=104593&group_id=4593&func=browse">bug database</a>.
