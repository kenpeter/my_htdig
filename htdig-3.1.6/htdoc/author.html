	  Andrew Scherpbier was the original author of ht://Dig.  He started work on
	  ht://Dig while working at <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">San Diego
	  State University</a>.  In August 1996, he formed his own
	  software company, <a href="http://www.contigo.com/">Contigo
	  Software</a>, together with several partners.  He currently is
	  Vice President of Research and Development at Contigo Software.

	  Unfortunately, since starting Contigo Software, Andrew has had
	  very little time to work on ht://Dig.  This is also the reason
	  that email regarding ht://Dig sent directly to Andrew will most
	  likely go unanswered.  Please direct questions to the
	  <a href="mailing.html">ht://Dig mailing list</a>.  Also make sure
	  you consult the <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>
	  page and browse or search the <a href="mailarchive.html">Mailing
	  list archive.</a>
