	<h2>
	  <a name="rundig">Building the databases</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
	  After setting up all the <a href="config.html">configuration
	  files</a>, you can build the required databases simply by running
	  <a href="rundig.html">rundig</a>. This script will run
	  <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> first to build the initial database,
	  then it runs <a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a> to create a document
	  index and word database from the files that were created by htdig.
	  It then runs <a href="htnotify.html">htnotify</a>, and finally
	  runs <a href="htfuzzy.html">htfuzzy</a> if necessary, to build
	  the endings and synonyms databases if they're missing or outdated.
	  The rundig script can be customized for your specific needs, or
	  you can develop your own script that runs any of these programs.
	  Read the reference sections for each of these programs to get a
	  better understanding of what each one does.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The <a href="htfuzzy.html">htfuzzy</a> program deserves a bit more
	  explaining. It is used to build databases that are used by some
	  of the fuzzy match algorithms selected by
	  <a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a>'s
	  <a href="attrs.html#search_algorithm">search_algorithm</a>
	  attribute. The <em>endings</em> and <em>synonyms</em> algorithms
	  use static dictionaries, so their databases only need to be rebuilt
	  by htfuzzy when the dictionary files are changed, or when ht://Dig
	  is initially installed. The rundig script handles the building of
	  these two databases as needed for the default setup. A few of the
	  other fuzzy match algorithms use databases that are derived from
	  the word database built by htdig/htmerge, so if you use these
	  algorithms you should rebuild their databases with htfuzzy every
	  time you update your index. This isn't done in rundig, but the
	  comments in the script show where you can add your htfuzzy commands
	  as needed. Some fuzzy match algorithms don't need their own
	  database, as they just operate on the word database, so they don't
	  need any special setup.
	</p>

	<h2>
	  <a name="testing">Testing and troubleshooting</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Once the databases are built, you should test out htsearch.
	  It's recommended that you first try a few queries running
	  htsearch on the command line, as it helps to separate problems
	  that are specific to ht://Dig from web server or CGI problems.
	  Once you have that working, try running htsearch from your web
	  browser, using the search form you configured.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you run into problems at any point in the building and testing
	  of your databases, there are many things you can do. All ht://Dig
	  programs feature a <strong>-v</strong> option to get some debugging
	  output. The more of these options you put on the command line, the
	  more output you'll usually get. To get help with common problems,
	  or with interpreting some of the debugging output, please look to
	  the ht://Dig <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> (frequently asked questions)
	  as your first line of support. Most of the problems that ht://Dig
	  users have are explained there, and the on-line
	  <a href="http://www.htdig.org/FAQ.html">FAQ on the website</a> is
	  updated frequently as new problems arise. The FAQ will also tell
	  you where you can turn if your question isn't answered there.
	  Remember that questions may not be phrased exactly as you'd state
	  them, so look carefully for anything that seems similar to the
	  problem you're trying to solve.
	</p>

	<h2>
	  <a name="maintenance">Maintaining the system</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Once everything is running, you have to deal with the question of
	  how you can keep everything running and up to date. The databases
	  don't automatically update themselves, of course, so you'll need
	  to figure out how to schedule automatic updates of the database.
	  Most users use the <strong>crontab</strong> facility on their
	  systems to schedule daily or weekly updates of their database.
	  This can be as simple as running "rundig" or "rundig -a" from
	  your crontab, or from a file in /etc/cron.daily if your system
	  uses this, to rebuild from scratch every night. For a small site,
	  this may take only a few minutes to run. Other sites will run
	  more elaborate update scripts, to update their existing databases
	  nightly, and schedule complete rebuilds less frequently, such as
	  monthly.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You need to pay close attention to how long updates take to run.
	  There are no database lockouts in ht://Dig, so you don't want to
	  schedule update or reindexing runs so frequently that they run
	  into each other.
	</p>
