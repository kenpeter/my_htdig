		  Description
		</h2>
	  </dd>
	  <dd>
		Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the HTTP protocol and
		gathers information from these documents which can later be
		used to search these documents. This program can be
		referred to as the search robot.
	  </dd>

	  </dd>
	  <dd>
		<dl compact>
		  <dt>
			-a
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Use alternate work files. Tells htdig to append <i>
			.work</i> to database files, causing a second copy of
			the database to be built. This allows the original
			files to be used by htsearch during the indexing run. When
			used without the "-i" flag for an update dig, htdig will
			use any existing .work files for the databases to update.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-c <em>configfile</em>
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Use the specified <i>configfile</i> file instead of the
			default.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-h <em>maxhops</em>
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Restrict the dig to documents that are at most <em>
			maxhops</em> links away from the starting document.
			This only works if <strong>-i</strong> is also given.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-i
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Initial. Do not use any old databases. This is
			accomplished by first erasing the databases.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-m [url_file]
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Minimal. Only index the URLs in the file provided and
			no others. The url_file can be a "-", causing htdig
			to read the URLs from the STDIN.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-s
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Print statistics about the dig after completion.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-t
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Create an ASCII version of the document database. This
			database is easy to parse with other programs so that
			information can be extracted from it for purposes other
			than searching. One could gather some interesting
			statistics from this database.
			<p>Each line in the file starts with the document id 
			followed by a list of
			<strong>\t<em>fieldname</em>:<em>value</em></strong>.
			The fields always appear in the order listed below:
			</p>
			<table border=0>
			<tr> <th>fieldname</th><th>value</th></tr>
			<tr> <td>u</td><td>URL</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>t</td><td>Title</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>a</td><td>State (0 = normal, 1 = not found, 2
			= not indexed, 3 = obsolete)</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>m</td><td>Last modification time as reported
			by the server</td></tr> 
			<tr> <td>s</td><td>Size in bytes</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>H</td><td>Excerpt</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>h</td><td>Meta description</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>l</td><td>Time of last retrieval</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>L</td><td>Count of the links in the document
			(outgoing links)</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>b</td><td>Count of the links to the document
			(incoming links or backlinks)</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>c</td><td>HopCount of this document</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>g</td><td>Signature of the document used for
			duplicate-detection</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>e</td><td>E-mail address to use for a
			notification message from htnotify</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>n</td><td>Date to send out a notification
			e-mail message</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>S</td><td>Subject for a notification e-mail
			message</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>d</td><td>The text of links pointing to this
			document. (e.g. &lt;a
			href=&quot;docURL&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;)</td></tr>
			<tr> <td>A</td><td>Anchors in the document (i.e. &lt;A
			NAME=...)</td></tr>
			</table>
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-u <em>username:password</em>
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Tells htdig to send the supplied username and password
			with each HTTP request. The credentials will be encoded
			using the 'Basic' authentication scheme. There <strong>
			HAS</strong> to be a colon (:) between the username and
			password.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			-v
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the
			program. Using more than 2 is probably only useful for
			debugging purposes. The default verbose mode (using
			only one -v) gives a nice progress report while
			digging. This progress report can be a bit
			cryptic, so here is a brief explanation. A line
			is shown for each URL, with 3 numbers before the
			URL and some symbols after the URL. The first
			number is the number of documents parsed so
			far, the second is the DocID for this document,
			and the third is the hop count of the document
			(number of hops from one of the start_url
			documents). After the URL, it shows a "*" for
			a link in the document that it already visited,
			a "+" for a new link it just queued, and a "-"
			for a link it rejected for any of a number of
			reasons. To find out what those reasons are,
			you need to run htdig with at least 3 -v options,
			i.e. -vvv. If there are no "*", "+" or "-" symbols
			after the URL, it doesn't mean the document was
			not parsed or was empty, but only that no links
			to other documents were found within it. With
			more verbose output, these symbols will get
			interspersed in several lines of debugging output.
		  </dd>
		  <dt>
			url_file (at end of arguments, after options)
		  </dt>
		  <dd>
			Get the list URLs to start indexing from the file
			provided. This will override the default start_url.
			The url_file can be a "-", causing htdig to read
			the URLs from the STDIN.
