	  The system performs three major tasks that should be
	  performed in the following order:
	</p>
	<h3>1. &nbsp;
	  <a href="#Digging">Digging</a>
	</h3>
	<dl>
	  <dd>
		Before you can search, a database of all the documents that
		need to be searched has to be created.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	<h3>2. &nbsp;
	  <a href="#Merging">Merging</a>
	</h3>
	<dl>
	  <dd>
	        Merging consists of two processes:
		<ol>
		<li>Converting the databases of all documents to
		specialized databases for simple, fast searching.</li>
		<li>Merging changed information into previously
		existing databases.</li>
		</ol>
		 Even though this task could be performed at the same time
		as the Digging, it is a separate process for efficiency
		reasons. This also allows for more control over the
		processes implemented when merging.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	<h3>3. &nbsp;
	  <a href="#Searching">Searching</a>
	</h3>
	<dl>
	  <dd>
		Finally, the databases that were created in the previous
		steps can be used for actual searches. Normally,
		searches will be invoked by a CGI (Common Gateway
		Interface; a program running on the webserver) which gets
		input from the user through an HTML form.
	  </dd>
	</dl>

	<h3>
	  <a name="Digging">Digging</a>
	</h3>
	<p class="main">
	  Digging is the first step in creating a search database. This
	  system uses the word <i>digging</i> while other systems call
	  it <i>harvesting</i> or <i>gathering</i>. In the ht://Dig
	  system, the program <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> performs
	  the information gathering stage. In this process, the program
	  will act as a regular web user, except that it will follow
	  <em>all</em> hyperlinks that it comes across. (Actually, it
	  will not follow all of them, just those that are within the
	  domain it needs to gather information on...)<br>
	   Each document it visits is examined and all the unique
	  words in this document are extracted and stored, excepting
	  those specified as <a href="attrs.html#minimum_word_length">
	  too short</a>, <a href="attrs.html#maximum_word_length">too
	  long</a>, or <a href="attrs.html#bad_words_list">to be
	  excluded</a> by the configuration.
	</p>
	<p class="main">
	  The digging process will create at least two files. The first
	  one is the list of all the words and the second one is a
	  database of URLs and information about the URLs. Other files
	  may be created for a list of all <a
	  href="attrs.html#create_url_list">URLs seen</a>, <a
	  href="attrs.html#create_image_list">all images seen</a>, <a
	  href="attrs.html#doc_list">ASCII versions</a> of the
	  databases, etc.
	</p>
	<hr noshade>
	<h3>
	  <a name="Merging">Merging</a>
	</h3>
	<p class="main">
	  Once the digging process is complete, the data must be
	  converted into something the search engine can actually use.
	  The <a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a> program does this.
	</p>
	  The term &quot;merge&quot; is used
	  because data from several databases is gathered together and
	  merged into several other databases. The source databases
	  include the databases created by the latest &quot;dig&quot; but also
	  any previous merged databases. The latest dig will produce a
	  database that provides information on new pages and
	  information on changes to previously existing pages; the
	  information on the new pages, and the new information on
	  changes to old pages is merged with the unchanged
	  information to create up-to-date databases.
	</p>
	<p class="main">
	  There are other, optional, tasks which are categorized under the
	  merge phase:
	</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>
		Expiration notification:
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		The ht://Dig system includes a handy reminder service,
		&quot;<a href="htnotify.html">htnotify</a>.&quot; This
		allows HTML authors to add some ht://Dig specific meta
		information in HTML documents. This meta information is
		used to email authors after a specified date. Very useful
		to maintain lists that contain those annoying 'new'
		graphics with new items. (Hint: things really aren't all
		that 'new' anymore after 6 months!)<br>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		Fuzzy word index creation:
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Allows searches using &quot;fuzzy&quot; algorithms to match
		words. The <a href="htfuzzy.html">htfuzzy</a> program can
		create indexes for several different algorithms.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	<hr noshade>
	<h3>
	  <a name="Searching">Searching</a>
	</h3>
	<p class="main">
	  Searching is where all the information gathered and
	  organized during the dig and merge stages gets put to use.
	  The <a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">
	  htsearch</a> program performs the actual searches. The CGI
	  program, using the HTML &quot;search form&quot; on the
	  website as input performs the search and produces the HTML
	  output (or, the &quot;failed search&quot;) which is seen by users.
