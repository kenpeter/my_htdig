	  This document will attempt to show the steps needed to build
	  and install the ht://Dig system.<br>
	  The main sections are:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<a href="where.html">Getting the software</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="#extract">Extracting the software</a>

	</ul>
	<hr noshade>
	<h2>
	  <a name="extract">Extracting the software</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
	  The distribution of ht://Dig is in the form of a gzipped tar
	  file. The name of the file will be something like <tt>
	  htdig-3.1.0.tar.gz</tt>. To extract, you can use either the GNU
	  tar command as follows:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  % <b>tar xzf <em>tarfile.tar.gz</em></b>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  If you do not have GNU tar, you can do the following:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  % <b>gunzip -c <em>tarfile.tar.gz</em> | tar xf -</b>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  In either case, a new directory will be created under which the
	  distribution will be extracted. The directory it creates will
	  be <tt>htdig-</tt> followed by the version number.
	</p>
	<hr noshade>
	<h2>
	  <a name="configure">Configure</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Once the distribution has been extracted, change to the newly
	  created directory.<br>
	  In this directory you will need execute the <tt>configure</tt> program:
	<blockquote>
	  % <b>./configure</b>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  This program will attempt to determine what your particular
	  system can and can't do.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The <b>configure</b> program may produce some warnings about
	  libguile and guile. Ignore those warnings since they do not
	  affect the ht://Dig program at all.
	</p>
	<p>
	  After this, you may wish to edit the file <tt>
	  CONFIG</tt>. There are several values which you need to
	  change in this file. Note that more recent versions of ht://Dig
	  (after 3.1.0b2) will allow you to use <pre>./configure
	  --prefix=</pre> and <pre>--exec-prefix=</pre> to set the DEST
	  and BIN_DIR variables automatically. As of the full 3.1.0
	  release, configure also supports setting the other directories
	  in CONFIG using the flags   --with-cgi-bin-dir=DIR,
	  --with-image-dir=DIR and --with-search-dir=DIR.
	</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>
		<tt>DEST</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		This is where all of the ht://Dig parts will be installed.
		Various other variables will use this value as their base.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>BIN_DIR</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		All the ht://Dig executable programs will go here.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>CONFIG_DIR</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Configuration files will be placed here.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>COMMON_DIR</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		This directory is for files which can be shared between
		different search databases.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>DATABASE_DIR</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Set this to the directory where the search databases are
		going to be. (Make sure there is plenty of space on the
		partition you put this on!)
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Point this to where all the tools will look for the
		configuration file. You can define this in terms of <tt>
		CONFIG_DIR</tt> if you'd like.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>CGIBIN_DIR</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		The directory where your HTTP server looks for CGI
		programs. This is where htsearch will get installed.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>IMAGE_DIR</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		Define this to be a place that can be accessed by your web
		server. This is where a couple of images will be installed.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>IMAGE_URL_PREFIX</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		This is the URL which points to the directory specified by
		the <tt>IMAGE_DIR</tt> variable above.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<tt>SEARCH_FORM</tt>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		The name of the file in which the sample search form will
		be installed.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	<hr noshade>
	<h2>
	  <a name="compile">Compile</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
	  The configure program will have created Makefiles in all the
	  important directories. It is important to note that the
	  Makefiles created assume that you use a <tt>make</tt> program
	  that knows how to deal with
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  include <em>filename</em>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  Some make programs do not allow this or have a different syntax
	  for including. In this case, you should probably obtain <a
	  href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/">GNU make</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At this point you can optionally add dependency information
	  to all the make files with the command
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  % <b>make depend</b>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  This only needs to be done if you are going to change any of
	  the sources to ht://Dig.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Now build the complete system with
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  % <b>make</b>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  (Sit back and relax for a while...)
	</p>
	<p>
	  If the compilation failed with the error that it cannot find
	  libht.a, the most likely problem is that your system does not
	  have libstdc++ installed. Please check the
	  <a href="require.html">system requirements</a> for details on this.
	</p>
	<hr noshade>
	<h2>
	  <a name="install">Install</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Everything should have built at this point. To install the
	  software, you need to execute
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  % <b>make install</b>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  This will perform several tasks. It will first attempt to
	  create the directories that you specified in the CONFIG file.
	  It will then copy the following programs to the <tt>
	  BIN_DIR</tt> directory you specified in the CONFIG file:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		htdig
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htmerge
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htfuzzy
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htnotify
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  It will also copy the htsearch program to your CGIBIN_DIR
	  directory.
	</p>
	<p>
	  After this, several files will be customized and installed.
	  Here is a list of the files that get installed:
	</p>
	  <blockquote>

		</dl>
	  </blockquote>
	<p>
	  Note that these files will <em>never</em> replace any existing
	  files that may already be installed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is also important to note that these files are mostly
	  examples. As they stand, they will work, but you probably
	  want to modify them to reflect your needs.
	</p>
	<p>
	  After the installation, you will be ready to test out
	  everything. You can use the <tt>rundig</tt> script to make a
	  test database of the online documentation at
	  http://www.htdig.org/
	</p>
	<p>
	  The only thing left to do is to modify the <tt>
	  htdig.conf</tt> config file which was placed in <em>
	  CONFIG_DIR</em>/htdig.conf. The <a href="attrs.html">
	  Configuration</a> manual has the details on how what
	  attributes are needed.
	  Then, you'll be ready to begin <a href="running.html">
	  running ht://Dig</a>.
