	<p>
	  All programs in the ht://Dig system
	  (<a href="htdig.html">htdig</a>, <a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a>,
	  <a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a>,
	  <a href="htfuzzy.html">htfuzzy</a>, and
	  <a href="htnotify.html">htnotify</a>) use a flexible configuration
	  file. This configuration file is a plain ASCII text file. Each line in
	  the file is either a comment or contains an attribute.
	  Comment lines are blank lines or lines that start with a '#'.
	  Attributes consist of a variable name and an associated
	  value:
	</p>
	<dl compact>
	  <dd>
		<tt>
		&lt;name&gt;:&lt;whitespace&gt;&lt;value&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</tt>
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	<p>
	  The &lt;name&gt; contains any alphanumeric character or
	  underline (_) The &lt;value&gt; can include any character
	  except newline. It also cannot start with spaces or tabs since
	  those are considered part of the whitespace after the colon. It
	  is important to keep in mind that any trailing spaces or tabs
	  will be included.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is possible to split the &lt;value&gt; across several
	  lines of the configuration file by ending each line with a
	  backslash (\). The effect on the value is that a space is
	  added where the line split occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Each program only extracts the attributes it needs and hence
	  it is most convenient to use the same configuration file with
	  all ht://Dig programs. If an attribute is specified more than
	  once in the file, only the last one will be used.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If a program needs a particular attribute and it is not in
	  the configuration file, it will use the default value which
	  is defined in <tt>htcommon/defaults.cc</tt>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A configuration file can include another file, by using the special
	  &lt;name&gt;, <tt>include</tt>. The &lt;value&gt; is taken as
	  the file name of another configuration file to be read in at
	  this point. If the given file name is not fully qualified, it is
	  taken relative to the directory in which the current configuration
	  file is found. Variable expansion is permitted in the file name.
	  Multiple include statements, and nested includes are also permitted.
	</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>
		<em>Example:</em>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		<tt>include: common.conf</tt>
	  </dd>
	</dl>
