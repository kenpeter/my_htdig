implement Nathan's DTD for XML output from htsearch, using htsearch
template files.

Files are:

HTDIG.DTD	- The data type definition for XML output from htsearch
README		- You're reading me now
nomatch.xml	- 4 XML template files, to go in your "common" directory
result.xml
syntax.xml
wrapper.xml
xml.conf	- htsearch configuration file, to go in your CONFIG_DIR
xmlsearch.cgi	- wrapper for htsearch 3.1.5
