# Now the really specific stuff for WWW Urls
# This one decodes the special Url macro which puts the URL reference
# inside a WP Comment (so it is hidden but editable) and makes the
# link text blue and underline
# If we find a comment inside an Url style pair defined by the user
# we can be pretty sure it was deliberate ( done by MACRO), so we
# have this special translation just for Comments inside Url Styles
# Course, if not defined (UrlComment) it will default to standard
#
UrlOn="%e"                          # Eat style codes
UrlOnEnd="%f"                       # Style end for UrlOn, restart output
# the comment text, passed as parameter 2 text, is the URL
UrlCommentOn="<a href=\""
UrlCommentOff="\">"                 #  URL link
UrlOff="</a>%e"                     # Anchor Off and eat style codes
UrlOffEnd="%f"                      # Style end for UrlOff, restart output
