This is a small example to demonstrate the script_name attribute.


Assuming that these files are located within your server's "search"
directory, just add the following line to your htdig configuration
file:

script_name:	/search/results.shtml

You may also have to override the standard template files, using the
search_results_header, search_results_footer, syntax_error_file and
nothing_found_file attributes.
