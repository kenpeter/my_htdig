ht://Dig contributed scripts

This directory tree contains perl and shell programs that attempt to
do things with the generated databases.  Most of these were written
for a very specific purpose for the specific version of ht://Dig that
was current at that point.  This means that some of these programs
will be severely broken!  Do not expect them to work; use them only as
examples of the types of things you can do with the ht://Dig
databases.

More contributed work is available on the ht://Dig website:
