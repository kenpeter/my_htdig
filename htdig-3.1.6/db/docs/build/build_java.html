<a name="compatibility">
<h3>Java Compatibility</h3></a>
Java DB has been tested with the <a href="http://www.javasoft.com"> Sun
Microsystems JDK 1.1</a> on Windows/NT and SunOS 5.5, and it should work
with any JDK 1.1 compatible environment.  The most important thing to
understand is whether the target Java environment supports the JNI (Java
Native Interface) which we use, rather than some other way for DLLs to
interface to java.  The JNI is new to JDK 1.1, but more likely to be
implementable across many platforms.

<a name="installation">
<h3>Java Installation</h3></a>
We expect that you've already installed the Java JDK or equivalent on your
system.  Since you are reading this, you also already have a copy of the
Berkeley DB package.  For the sake of discussion, we'll assume it's in a
directory called db-VERSION, e.g., you extracted Berkeley DB version 2.3.12
and you did not change the top-level directory name.  The files related to
Java are in two subdirectories of db-VERSION: java, the java source files,
and libdb_java, the C++ files that provide the "glue" between java and
Berkeley DB.  The directory tree looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
                        db-VERSION
                       /          \
                    java        libdb_java
                     |              |
                    src            ...
                     |
                 sleepycat
                /         \
               db       examples
               |           |
              ...         ...
</pre>
<p>
This naming conforms to the emerging standard for naming java packages.
When the java code is built, it is placed into a <b>classes</b> subdirectory
that is parallel to the <b>src</b> subdirectory.

<a name="building">
<h3>Building Java</h3></a>
Both db-VERSION/java and db-VERSION/libdb_java have Makefiles:
<ul><pre>
Makefile.win32
Makefile.unix
</pre></ul>
<p>
The java directory can be built using your make command and the
appropriate Makefile.  If you've never built java code before, there
are two things you will need to do before issuing the make command.

<p>
First, make sure the java compiler (usually <b>javac</b>) is in your path.
If you installed the sun JDK distribution in /usr/java , then the java tools
are in the directory /usr/java/bin.

<p>
Make sure your classpath is set correctly.  Set your environment variable
CLASSPATH to contain at least the standard class library (perhaps in
/usr/java/lib/classes.zip) and add the Berkeley DB classes in as well.
Using the UNIX csh, this might be:

<ul><pre>
setenv CLASSPATH "/usr/java/lib/classes.zip:/db-VERSION/java/classes"
</pre></ul>

<p>
On Windows/95, your autoexec.bat would need to have something like:

<ul><pre>
set CLASSPATH="c:/java/lib/classes.zip;c:/db-VERSION/java/classes"
</pre></ul>

<p>
Note the use of semicolons on Windows.  On Windows/NT, you'll set this
variable in the control panel.

<p>
Now you can run make to build the java directory, e.g.:
<ul><pre>
cd db-VERSION/java
make -f Makefile.unix
</pre></ul>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<a name="shared">
<h3>Building a shared library version of Berkeley DB</h3></a>
If you are on Windows/NT or Windows, you can build a shared lib version
of Berkeley DB by opening the build.win32/Berkeley_DB.dsw workspace and
selecting target DB_DLL.  Set the configuration to Win32 Debug, and build.
Make sure there is a build.win32/Debug/libdb.dll as a result.

<p>
If you are on UNIX, you will need to do a little extra work to build a
shared library version of Berkeley DB.  By default, Berkeley DB builds
as a static library.  If you've already built Berkeley DB, you can copy
your build directory to use as a work space, e.g.:

<ul><pre>
% cd db-VERSION
% cp -r build.unix build.shlib
% cd build.shlib
% make clean
</pre></ul>

<p>
Now you'll need to consult your system documentation to understand how to
build Berkeley DB as a shared library.  As UNIX architectures do not all
build shared libraries the same way, Berkeley DB is not distributed with
support for building shared libraries.  You MUST build Berkeley DB as a
shared library before you proceed beyond this step.

<p>
Examples for building shared library versions of Berkeley DB are available
for <a href="shared_hp.html">HP/UX</a> and <a href="shared_gcc.html">the
generic GCC compiler</a>.
If you build a shared library version of Berkeley DB for a compiler and
architecture combination for which we do not have an example, please
email the procedure to us at db@sleepycat.com, and we'll add it to the
collection.

<hr size=1 noshade>

<a name="libdb_java">
<h3>Building libdb_java</h3></a>
Before building libdb_java, make sure you have a shared library version
of Berkeley DB (see above).

<p>
On UNIX:

<p>
NB: The libdb_java/Makefile.unix Makefile is written to expect that the
system compiler is named "gcc" and is the GNU C compiler.  In addition,
it uses compiler-specific options when building.  If you are using a
different compiler than gcc, you'll need to modify Makefile.unix to work
with it.

<p>
First, edit the line at the beginning of libdb_java/Makefile.unix:
<ul><pre>
JAVAINSDIR=	/usr/java1.1/
</pre></ul>

<p>
Change JAVAINSDIR to be the top level directory of your java JDK tree.
This is the level above the bin and include directories.  Then issue a
make command in the libdb_java directory:

<ul><pre>
% cd db-VERSION/libdb_java
% make -f Makefile.unix
</pre></ul>

<p>
On Win/:

<p>
Issue the nmake command in the libdb_java directory:

<ul><pre>
C:\db_distribution\libdb_java> nmake /f Makefile.win32
</pre></ul>

<a name="usage_notes">
<h3>General Usage Notes</h3></a>
For your application to use Db successfully, you must set your CLASSPATH
environment variable to include db-VERSION/java/classes as well as the
classes in your java distribution.  See the section above on "BUILDING
JAVA" for further information.

<p>
On Windows, you will want to set your PATH variable to include:
<ul><pre>
db-VERSION/java/java_db;db-VERSION/build.win32/debug
</pre></ul>

<p>
On UNIX, you will want to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include:
<ul><pre>
db-VERSION/java/java_db;db-VERSION/build.unix
</pre></ul>

<p>
These are the locations of your shared libraries.  If you get a:
<ul><pre>
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError
</pre></ul>
exception when you run, chances are you do not have the PATH set up
correctly.

<p>
Or, of course, you may copy the built dynamic libraries (libdb and
java_db) to a directory already in your path.

<p>
To ensure that everything is running correctly, you may want to try a
simple test from the example programs in:
<ul><pre>
db-VERSION/java/src/com/sleepycat/examples
</pre></ul>

<p>
(which should have been built in the "BUILDING JAVA" section above):
<ul><pre>
% java com.sleepycat.examples.AccessExample
</pre></ul>

<p>
This example program will prompt for text input lines which are then
stored with their reversed text in a simple Btree named "db.access" in
your current directly.  Try giving it two lines of text and then
end-of-file.  Before it exits, you should see the reversed text.  If you
run it again, lines will be there from your previous run.  This is an
excellent check to make sure the fundamental things are working right.

<p>
NOTE: when you run some of the other examples on Solaris, you may get an
"rmutex" libc error message.  This is a known bug in Solaris 2.5, and it
is fixed by Sun patch 103187-25.  See the Sleepycat Software Release FAQ
web page (www.sleepycat.com) for further information on this problem.
