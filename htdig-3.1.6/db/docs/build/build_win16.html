<h1 align=center>Building for Windows 3.1 platforms</h1>
<p>
Windows 3.1 support for Berkeley DB can be found in the build_win16
directory.
<p>
This source has only been built using Watcom IDE 11.0 (under NT 4.0).
Create a project, then add the .c files (not all of the clib or util
files), and build a dll.  You'll need to find the -I configuration,
to add search locations for header files.
<p>
The "shared memory" support relies on the fact that the code will be
in a dll, so if we want static libraries we'll have to revisit that
work.
