  THE ART OF PLAYING MUSICAL FENCES<p>In 1985, international violinist Jon Rose was driving, car windows down, out of Broken Hill when he heard something he'd never heard before. ``An incredible sound.' A fence was, in technical terms ``excited', vibrating in the wind, producing a broad harmonic sound. Jon Rose was excited too.<p>The musician who had already spent over 10 years experimenting with stringed instruments both conventional and invented, had found the ultimate challenge - a sonic network that covered the continent. It was obvious: he had to play fences.<p>This month, Rose and his partner, the American violinist Hollis Taylor, are performing the fruits of that early inspiration, Bowing Fences, as part of the Melbourne Festival. They'll make 60 appearances, improvising together, using cello bows applied to a 16-metre fence erected in the George Adamson Gallery of the Victorian Arts Centre.<p>The musicians have 87 years, and a depth of experience, between them. `Between us we've done everything on, with, and about violins, that you could imagine - and more,' says Rose. The 'fence thing' was merely an extension. 'A lot of people just look at fences as fences - we see millions of miles of musical instruments.'<p>Rose, 51, a British-born Australian who often works overseas, has played the violin since he was seven. He has appeared on more than 60 records and CDs, and performs in dozens of concerts and international festivals each year. He holds his own 'String 'em up' festival of radical string players. He has played bebop to big band, sitar to country-and-western and violin with interactive electronics.<p>Taylor too, defies pigeon-holes and blurs the lines of classical, jazz and folk music as a performer and composer. Once the youngest member of the Oregon Symphony, she went on to win the Oregon State Fiddle Championship and has featured in the films, My Own Private Idaho and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.<p>The couple met eight years ago but Taylor didn't hear Rose play fences until four years ago at an avant-garde string festival in Berlin. 'It sounds like such an odd thing to do,' she says. But when she listened to him also playing at a sheep station in Western Australia, she was converted. 'The local people, the station hands and ranchers, were totally mesmerised by this sound. Then I had to re-think.'<p>The couple now has a practice fence on the balcony of their Sydney terrace<br>house.<p>Bowing Fences is the first public taste of a larger work in progress - Great Australian Fences. Rose and Hollis are travelling Australia at intervals, surveying fences, making recordings, documenting the lives of those who work on, or live within, them. They set off for three months in February, towing a rented campervan, Taylor driving, Rose spotting. They look for fences that work acoustically and which look good. They're filming the trip for an ABC website and making recordings for a radiophonic work. Taylor is writing 'an alternative' travel book.<p>They've talked to fence runners (the people who maintain fences), station owners and an Aboriginal tour guide about the history of their fences, hearing tales of murder and madness in the outback. They've pondered metaphysical and political notions of boundaries, belonging and ownership. They've encountered parts of the rabbit-proof fence that stretches the length of Western Australia, coast to coast, and the wild dog or dingo fence, more than twice as long as the Great Wall of China.<p>Rose says people they talk to are usually 'totally positive' about their fence-playing. He clips a contact microphone to the post and hands them headphones as the pair taps, saws, strokes and drums the wire. 'The reaction borders on amazement, their jaws drop to their ankles.'<p>Listening to a recording of fence music is an intriguing experience. It hums, reverberates, buzzes, soars and clangs, at times ethereal, at times discordant, at worse tortuous, but always evocative. Industrial clamour, haunts of jazz, rural noises.<p>The sounds a fence emits - the pitch and the harmonic series - varies according to how tightly it's strung, the thickness of the wire, the distance between posts and whether the fence is straight. Taylor, who has perfect pitch, can identify single notes; Rose hears 'harmonic possibilities'. The best fence is a brand new five-wire fence. An electric fence adds an extra click (because of the pulse) but is, of course, impractical to play.<p>Rose had his 'first major experience with electrocution' in Finland in the mid-90s. Freezing cold outside the concert hall, but hot and dry inside, he got shocked as soon as he touched the fence erected for the 40-minute performance. 'An incredible whack up the arm,' he says. When he asked a technician whether something could be done about it, he was told in a clipped Finnish voice, 'Everybody will be electrocuted! It's normal! You will adjust!' Rose was electrocuted hundreds of times as he played. 'But it was a very good recording.'<p>Rose plays suburban fences too, making recordings early in the morning when there is less background noise or traffic. 'When I'm playing a wooden fence in the suburbs, I play solo while Hollis stands at the end of the street watching out for police. It might be 2am and it's incredibly loud. There's only a small window of opportunity.'<p>They wanted to play the security fence surrounding Pine Gap but were denied access. 'We'd love to play Woomera,' says Taylor. 'That is some fence!' adds Rose. But for the duration of the festival, they'll be playing indoors at the Victorian Arts Centre.<p>For more information on the art of playing musical fences, the relative violins, interactive violin bows, the Rosenbergs: www.jonroseweb.com
