  Designed to introduce arriving passengers (gently) to a new and different part of the world. Uses sound, murals and painting. Environmental found sounds were used, sourced from the nearby Barrier Reef, the Daintree Rainforest plus the fringe between both. Morning, afternoon and night sounds were identified, recorded, archived, compiled and layered into a bunch of ram cards (using data compression), constructed around a 'travelling story' of equating an aircraft 'coming ashore' from the sea/sky, through the landing fingers onto the 'beach'/concourse, down under to a 'rainforest canopy'/customs hall and luggage collection and out into the arrivals hall/real time Cairns soundscape.<p>An Indigenous mural - introducing the passengers to the creation myth of the Cairns area – was featured in the collection area and had its own sound track. Each track was looped, the cycling sounds (sea, atmos,) not needing too much time; any track with louder or identifiable features was given as much time (between repeats) as possible!<h4>Technical Description (by Peter Blackmore)</h4>The Cairns Port Authority (CPA), operators of the Cairns International Airport, had the objective of creating a friendly experience for people arriving on international flights.  This experience was to serve as an introduction to Cairns.  The system was designed and installed through 1996-7 <br> <br>The CPA sought linear artwork and a soundscape to build knowledge of Cairns and its attractions as the disembarking passengers progressed throughout the terminal.   <br> <br>Peter Blackmore, principal of AVDEC, was engaged to design the sound experience and its delivery mechanism.  He recommended Peter Mumme as an artist capable of producing an original sound experience.  As the three foci of the linear art were Reef, Rainforest and Aborignals, Mumme set out to record appropriate sounds   <br> <br>Peter Blackmore was concerned that the soundscape be totally automated and maintenance free.  So the replay systems were based around the first Philips SSM solid-state modules.  These modules do not require heads to be cleaned, nor tapes to wear, or lasers to die.   <br> <br>There were multiple sound channels for some of the areas, so he devised a system whereby there were numerous power amplifier channels feeding just two loudspeakers each.   <br> <br>Blackmore commissioned the design and manufacture of Australian-made eight-channel amplifiers, with digital volume controls.  These were to drive the one hundred and twenty flat panel loudspeakers, which the artists painted over so that the passengers would not be aware of their location.  These loudspeakers have a very wide dispersion pattern, reducing the number needed to gain maximum effect.   <br> <br>In the Arrivals Hall, six large bipolar flat panel loudspeakers were used.  Each was fed with a unique soundtrack, with the resultant diffusing/melding effects recreating the chaos of the rainforest.   <br> <br>Mumme devised a number of soundtracks apposite to three times of day – Morning, afternoon and nighttime.  <br> <br>The automation that Blackmore designed is linked to the Flight Information Display (FID) that drives the visual displays around the terminal.  As a jet touches down, the Control Tower activates the FID, letting people know which terminal finger the plane will be parking at.   <br> <br>Once activated, the control system slowly ramps up the volume over a five-minute period, ensuring that people in the terminal do not quickly become aware of its presence.  Rather, it envelops the listener slowly.  We observed a positive change in mood of individuals waiting in the Arrivals Hall as the sounds appeared.  <br> <br>One other aspect of the soundtracks being that the morning track is designed to be –pre-sunrise.  John White, the control system programmer, used a look-up table provided by the Meteorological Bureau to ensure that sunrise/sunset times shifted appropriately for each day of the year.   <br> <br>The Control system is linked to a modem so that diagnostics can be remotely checked.  This was used once when White was in London and CPA had requested a small change to the programme.  He made the changes and downloaded them from his hotel room within one hour.  CPA were very impressed with this!<br> <br><h4>Sound Design (Peter Mumme’s Description)</h4>We utilized environmental sound recorded from: the Daintree Rainforest; the Great Barrier Reef; traditional song/stories from the local Yirrigandji community; plus local sounds from Cairns. The 'sound experience' was scored as an allegory; people arriving via airplanes and the airport arrivals situations being equated with arriving in a new country via a (sub) marine environment through beaches, rain-forest and out into a 'real time' world.<br> <br>We worked with some 6 hours of archived sound, reducing this to an operational time of some 30'.  MPEG compression was utilized on the storage media. We achieved a seemingly 'random' playback - given the somewhat limited storage times/bandwidth achievable (in 1996) - by using asymmetric loops, dynamics and careful spatial (non) positioning of any repeating sound sequence. Non-dynamic sounds used short loops whilst loud ones used long ones. Lengths varied from 12-15" up to minutes.<br> <br>Playback is reasonably quiet, the aim being the creation of an immersive total environment. Overall levels are not altered during passenger traversals. The sound system ramps down about 1 hr after initiation unless re-triggering has occurred.<br> <br>There was, and still is, considerable pressure coming from various lobby groups who view this installation as a 'commercial opportunity' for advertising.
