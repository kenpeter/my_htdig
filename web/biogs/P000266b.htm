  This concept of a work of public art for the summit of Mt Keira was derived from a functional analysis of the site and subsequent research and consultations. The research into the many diverse subject areas of Mt Keira revealed many interesting aspects of history worthy of depiction, but there is no way all of these could be illustrated or directly referred to. Judicious editing of content for inclusion ensued.<p><h3>Concept</h3><p>The function of this work of art is to provide an intermediate or foyer space for visitors to contemplate their surroundings, calm down from being in traffic on a busy highway and become informed about the site before encountering the fabulous view. The views are likely to overpower all other considerations. We hope with this work, to provide a context for the visual experience of all the site - not just the lookouts!<p>Essentially we are attempting to manifest the existance of Oola-boola-woo and Geera, especially as told in the Five Islands Legend.<p>This sculptural environment has 2 parts, - a sound sculpture which will help give voice to the West Wind and a simple concrete and terrazzo element (mostly covered in real mulch) which represents a Brush Turkey mound and the rock (sandstone) that Geera turned into by sitting in the one place so long. We felt it was important to acknowledge that Geera means the Mountain as well as the Brush Turkey.<p><h3>Description</h3><p>When entering the car park the first objects to be seen (apart from 2 great trees) are the 3 decorated natural totem poles joined by stainless steel wires. This sound structure represents the collaboration between Aboriginal and non-aboriginal people to create a harmonious Australia. The structure is a mix of the European Aeolian Harp and the Didjeridoo. Two of the totems are totally hollow and the third is partially hollow. This one houses a wind chime. These immediately tell the visitor which way to go to the lookouts. Depending on the strength of the wind, this structure will sing the visitors a welcome. It is oriented to give voice to the winds from the North East, the South East and of course the West (Oola-boola-woo). The sound will be soft and subtle but mostly audible. Sometimes it will be silent. It is said that women first discovered the Didjeridoo but men took it from them. These didjeridoo like totems are symbolically returned to the women in this special place.<p>Upon approaching the totems the mound is encountered, it is a pile of leaves and twigs with areas of what looks like coloured rock showing through, except this rock is more geometrically patterned and coloured. This contrasts with the randomness of the twigs etc. These two more natural elements are contrasted with 3 bands of coloured terrazzo encircling and framing the mound. These represent on one side, the green slopes below the lookout, the yellow beaches and the aqua coloured sea. This side will have the words Wodi-Wodi inscribed. And on the other side the ochreish sandy soil of the woodlands and the darker brown fecund soil of the forest floor is shown with the word Thurawal. Some small bronze cast animal and bird footprints are imbedded in the terrazzo.<p>Around the terrazzo is coloured concrete and or coloured paving bricks of  semi-polished concrete. The words Merrigong - Illawarra Escarpment are inscribed on one side and Mt Keira and Geera on the other. The six rocks represent the six daughters of Oola-boola-woo and the six environmental sculptures proposed for the whole Merrigong Project. The names of the six daughters (Mimosa, Wilga, Lilli Pilli, Wattle, Clematis and Geera) will be written in the concrete. <p>By having the 'stone' visible under or as part of, the mound we are referring to the earth as being the source of everything that inhabits it and we should not forget it. The mound (all the land) is the nurturer of the eggs the young - our future and by extention all inhabitants. Only by acknowledging this will our existence continue. To this end we have made the concious decision to include the real materials of the mound of the Brush Turkey - fallen leaves and twigs and earth etc., this may seem strange to some but this reminds us that all things are of value. The Brush Turkey here is the representative of all Flora and Fauna. Also visitors (especially kids) can add twigs and leaves to the mound - giving the work a participatory aspect.<p>As the restaurant is open at least 2 nights per week lighting needs to be considered.<p><h3>Research and consultation</h3><p>Lynn and Peter thank the many people who gave their time and information for the benefit of the project groups and people consulted included:-<br>Aunty Rita ……..<br>Uncle………….<br>………………..<br>Kevin Mills<br>Quality Environment and Management Consultants<br>National Parks and Wildlife Service<br>Mountain Top Restaurant - Joe and Bill<br>June Pronk<br>Staff of Wollongong City Council<br>Aboriginal Studies Unit, Wollongong University<br>Ros Bandt<br>Kitty Eggerking<br>And many friends, artists and contacts overseas.<p><h3>Response to comments of committee</h3><p>Feedback from the committee was beneficial to us as we were then able to amend our design to better suit the site. We have moved the 'foyer' element back towards the position of the stump, this will also allow 2 places be reserved for emergency vehicles and provide a more obvious entrance to the lookouts. We disguarded the bronze element. We researched and consulted thoroughly and addressed the context and content of the site. We have enlarged the anticipated size of the work a little to now be 8m diameter. We have abandoned the mosaics. The images they would have depicted will now be carved/burnt into the totem poles. These will relate to some of the other legends we have come to know about including the Whale and Canoe. These details would be the subject of further face to face consultation with Aboriginal representatives.<p><h3>Selection Criterea</h3><p><h4>Sensitivity to the surrounding environment</h4><p>The sculpture is respectful and responsive to the surrounding environment. By utilising naturally occurring materials and the terrazzo which is already incorporated in the Rotary monument and not employing any environmentally harmful techniques, we believe that we are being sensitive to the Environment. This work of art is subtle and will not dominate.<p><h4>Including the use of natural materials</h4><p>Utilising existing and the natural materials of timber, rock, (already on site) terrazzo (cement incorporating rock) and twigs, leaves and earth.<p><h4>Low maintenance and high durability</h4><p>All these materials are low maintenance and durable, concrete and terrazzo have been used externally for centuries.<p><h4>Consideration of public access, public safety and use of surrounding space</h4><p>We believe that this proposal embellishes public access, safety and amenity by utilising the space efficiently. It will make the car park safer.<p><h4>Ease of manufacture and installation</h4><p>A large percentage of the manufacturing process can be carried out off site, thus minimising site disruption. It is not anticipated that any untried or difficult technologies will be employed. Installation should only take a few days to a week. Totem elements will be concreted into the ground.<p><h4>Encouraging interpretation and reflection in viewers</h4><p>The content of the piece has largely been determined through the consultation and research process, so it is relevant to the site and therefore of great interest to visitors. The content may also be described in a plaque or sign explaining the words, diagrams, images and patterns on the sculpture. <p>The sculptural environment is arranged in such a way as to encourage prolonged viewing but to also lead people through the work to the lookout experience.<p><h4>Reflecting the historical and spiritual meanings of the site</h4><p>The legend of the Five Islands is depicted as are other legends. The history of the site is reflected in the history of the Brush Turkey which was wiped out in the area a hundred years ago but has now returned. Not in large numbers so it has to be encouraged, nurtured and understood. (like so many other inhabitants of nature)<p><h4>Evidence of research undertaken</h4><p>Lynn has been in touch with her South Coast relatives and other Aboriginal people. She has discussed the project with them and noted their comments. Peter has worked in the Wollongong area for 6 years and knows the site and surrounding area well. The site has been visited numerous times. Further specific research has been undertaken in the Local Studies Section of the Wollongong Library, Aboriginal Studies Unit of the University of Wollongong, the internet, and personal contact with other interested and expert individuals.<p><h3>Options</h3><p>Lighting - it would be possible to incorporate some fibre optic lighting in the sculpture, both in and around the mound and also on the wires and in the wind chime chamber.<p>Recording - It is a relatively simple task to transfere the electronically 'picked up' sound to the restaurant and played as subtle background music. Also these sounds could be recorded and combined with a commissioned composition and sold as a CD. There is quite a lot of this type material available and often played on the ABC. Orchestra's nowadays often use pre-recorded sound in live performances, perhaps the Wollongong Symphony Orchestra may be interested.<p>Leaflet - A more comprehensive explanation than that given at the sculpture could be put into a leaflet available at the Kiosk.<p>Postcard - Could be purchased at the Kiosk<p>New landscape plan - The names of 5 of the daughters of the west wind are botanical. Small groves of these trees and shrubs could be planted with an identifying name plate and information. The plants are Clematis, Wattle, Lilli Pilli, Mimosa and Wilga (known as Wilkeia, a sub-tropical rainforest shrub of 2-4 meters, with leathery leaves, found in the National Park and the Illawarra).
