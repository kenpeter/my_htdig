  Walking the Faultlines (1998; released on CD-Rom 2000), by Hazel Smith, Roger Dean and Greg White. <br>A work created for cd-rom interactive participation, and amongst the winners of a competitive submission to the International Computer Music Association, who released it in 2000, on their ‘Cyberquilts’ CD-Rom anthology. The work can also be presented in performance with performed text, and the interactive sound and text from the cd-rom displayed.<p>The cd-rom comprises sound (best played after transfer to hard disc), and a text display, both driven interactively from a computer. Up to 3 sound fields (comprising both verbal and non-verbal sound) can coexist with the displayed text fields.  <p>The hypertext for the visual display consists of a large number of short texts of poetry, prose and constructed language, through which it is possible to take pathways which are multidimensional (for example, in the sense that from any point in the display it is possible to access directly any other). The texts explore the extremes or 'faultlines' of the concepts of subjectivity, language and location. <br>The oral text repeats, links and/or transforms the text for visual display, and consists of three elements: a poem, a spoken passage of the constructed language, and a monologue. The monologue and constructed language push the boundaries of behaviour and language. The other soundwork on cd comprises compositions for keyboard  instruments, and computer-modified verbal and other electro-acoustic sound pieces. <p>‘Walking the Fault Lines’ makes demands on the viewer/ listener which are different from normal linear reading habits. It is multi-dimensional, so that the listener/ viewer can take many different routes through it and also perceive a number of events simultaneously.  Each viewer/listener will therefore construct a new multi-layered version of the work.  <p>The sound on the cd-rom comprises multiple sound files produced as recordings of performed text, rain, and instrumental keyboard sounds; in some cases, these were subjected to digital manipulations, in others the sound piece was generated by algorithmic programming in MAX. The interface provides buttons by which the participant triggers new processes and new sound files, but does not provide information in advance as to the impact of the trigger. There are both defined pathways through the sound files, and random ones, and there are self-activating triggers if the user does not trigger sound (or text) for a certain length of time. A salient feature of the sound world is the use of high quality stereo sounds (though compressed), and the real-time transmutation of the sound which several of the triggered MAX patches effect as the user progresses. Thus some of the individual sound files appear in several guises, with continuous sonic transformation as they play. This feature is not designed to be obvious, since some of the transformations are intrinsic to the sound files as originally produced, and stored on the cd-r; however, even moderate listening to the work will reveal such processes to the attentive listener. <p>Credits : Composition of verbal  and sound works : Hazel Smith and Roger Dean; Text performance : Hazel Smith, with digital recording by Greg White; Computer sound control, and interactive computer programming : Roger Dean, Greg White; Production and technical collaboration : Greg White and Roger Dean; original analogue recordings of rain-induced sound: Paul Brennan.
