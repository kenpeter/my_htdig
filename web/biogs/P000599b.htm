  <p> David Murphy &rsquo;s practice blurs the boundaries of sculpture, physics, sonic experimentation and instrument making. Murphy has studied art, music and construction over a wide range of fields and disciplines to fuel his desire to create eclectic works of intrigue and beauty. Much of his work relates to a search for the unseen that lies at the core of the world around us. At present he is preoccupied in his work with developing means by which to see sound and music, and with investigating the relationship between geometry (2 and 3 dimensional) and music. </p><p> He has worked collaboratively with a broad range of artists in film, theatre, music performance and the visual Arts at a variety of Festivals and events both here and abroad. He has a number of permanent sculptures around Melbourne, but has worked extensively on ephemeral and event based works as well. In 1995 Murphy, along with Anderson Hunt and Cameron Robbins, established Down St. Studios in Collingwood, Victoria, a collective of site-specific sculptors specializing in large-scale public works of art. The company is currently involved in developing new works for the City of Melbourne, Ballarat Grammar and Frankston </p><p> Murphy was the recipient of the peoples choice award for his work <em>Unfurling Fibonacci</em> in the 2003 Helen Lempriere National Sculpture award and some of his recent works include: </p><ul><li><em> Bringing out the Organ, </em> a collaboration with Erik Griswold on the Grand Organ at the Melbourne Town Hall that was part of <em>The Current, </em>presented by Double Venturi and the City of Melbourne. </li><li><em> Raphael Stone Calendar</em> , a seasonal calendar of stone and bronze sculptures marking annual celestial events, as well as the mundane, for Frankston City Council, 2005 </li><li><em> The Bush Kit, </em> a &ldquo;junk&rdquo; drum kit set in concrete that accompanies Graeme Leak&rsquo;s permanent work <em>The Musical Fence </em>in Winton, Queensland in 2005 </li><li><em> The Circular Harp and Resulting Images</em> , a performance on Murphy&rsquo;s <em>Circular Harp</em> with Graeme Leak and Greg Sheehan about the juncture of music and the geometry at the REV festival, Brisbane Powerhouse 2002. </li><li><em> The Weather Harp</em> , a wind played harp based on a limpit&rsquo;s shell. This work was with Cameron Robbins and was a laneway commission for the City of Melbourne in 2003 </li><li><em> The Spoonaphone</em> and the <em>Hills Harp, </em>two new instruments commissioned by Linsey Pollak for the <em>Sound Forest</em> as part of the 2003 Queensland Music Festival </li><li><em> H2O Stint Map</em> , a site-specific sculpture about the relationship between the migratory birds at Chetham wetlands, the Fibonacci numbers and the water molecule for Hobson&rsquo;s Bay City Council, 2004. </li><li><em> Fibonacci&rsquo;s Flowers,</em> this was an environmental work that amplified the sounds produced in a single strand of fencing wire that ran through the Burragorang forest by means of large wire and paper &ldquo;flowers&rdquo;. This was part of the Burragorang international Artist Camp in 2003 </li></ul><p><a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~sculptor/news/may01/triangle.htm">home.vicnet.net.au/~sculptor/news/may01/triangle.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.burragorang.org/workshop03/Artists/Artists.html">http://www.burragorang.org/workshop03/Artists/Artists.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/arts/adlib/stories/s880964.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/arts/adlib/stories/s880964.htm</a></p>
