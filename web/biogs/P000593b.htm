  <blockquote><p><em> After a full explanation of what my object was, I purchased two large tracts of land from them - about 600,000 acres, more or less, and delivered over to them blankets, knives, looking glasses, tomahawks, beads, scissors, flour, as payment for the land; and also agreed to give them a tribute, or rent, yearly.</em></p><p> (John Batman, 1835) </p><p><em>In the midst of the chaos that has overtaken the land of the Wurundjeri, a zone of reflection will stand for three weeks, for contemplation and consideration of the possibility that through our differences we might also recognise our shared humanity.</em> </p><p>(Artist&rsquo;s Statement, Chris Knowles, 1997) </p></blockquote><p><strong> &ldquo;</strong>The Lie of the Land<strong>&rdquo;</strong> is a public art work created by artists Fiona Foley and Chris Knowles. It was commissioned in 1997 by the City of Melbourne as a gift to the people of Melbourne to coincide with the National Aboriginal Reconciliation Conference. (This is the conference at which Prime Minister John Howard insulted the indigenous population in his opening speech, and where indigenous members and others in the audience stood and turned their backs to him in silent protest.)</p><p> The work is a collaboration between the artists, local Aboriginal groups and individuals, and members of the community from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.</p><p> This is the original concept outline for the sound component of the work:</p><p> A small number of audio CDs will contain tracks of readings of the John Batman quote in seven languages; English, Wurundjeri (translated and read by Joy Murphy), Indonesian, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Chinese. </p><p> The CDs&rsquo; will contain further tracks which will be spoken lists of words from the quote; &quot;blankets, knives, looking glasses, tomahawks, beads, scissors, flour... &quot; </p><p> Still more tracks will contain sound recordings of two totems of the Port Phillip Bay area; Waang, the Crow, and Bunjil, the Eagle. </p><p> These sounds will be distributed through an array of small speakers located around the site of the artwork, allowing any sound to appear at any location and move around within the defined area. Controlled by computer, the sounds can be additionally shaped and moved in space. They can be made to murmur, chant, and sometimes shout, or burst into gradually diminishing choruses of crows and voices. The installation will be programmed to respond differently at night, and at other times, to suit the requirements of the environment. </p><p> &quot;The Lie of the Land&quot; was originally installed in front of the Melbourne Town Hall in Swanston Street for a period of three weeks, which was then extended to two months. During this time the City Council decided to purchase the work with the intention of permanent installation at that location. Various restrictions subsequently made that site unsuitable for permanent installation of the work, so it was decided to house it within the new Museum of Victoria, which was currently under construction at Carlton Gardens.</p><p> The move from the hustle and bustle of Swanston street at a city intersection (for which the sound installation was designed) to the sanctity of a sunken courtyard within a major cultural institution presented challenges in the areas of acoustics, technology, cultural and artistic requirements, and, administration. Eventually however the work was re-executed and realised within the new context.</p>In reflecting after almost ten years, as an artist I am still pleased with this work, but sad that the process of reconciliation stalled in the time since Lie of the Land was completed.
