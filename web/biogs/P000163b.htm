He has been commissioned extensively in Australia the United Kingdom and Germany, producing original compositions and sound designs for over 30 film, theater, and installation works in the last ten years.<p>Paine is particularly fascinated with sound as an exhibitable object.  This passion has led to the creation of several interactive responsive environments where the inhabitant generates the sonic landscape through their presence and behaviors.  It has also led to a considerable body of work that creates music scores for dance in realtime using video tracking of the choreography.<p>In 1999 Garth Paine was composer in residence at the Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung (State Institute for Music Research - SIM) in Berlin, exhibiting his installation MAP1 in the Musical Instrument museum, Berlin during the residency. He was commissioned by SIM to produce MAP2, which was exhibited at the Museum for Musical Instruments, Berlin from December 30, 1999 to January 8, 2000. His installation work REEDS was presented by the Melbourne International Festival, 2000.   <p>His most recent works include the score for the Belvoir Company B production of the Laramie Project, which opened in Sydney in March 2001; Company in Space’s Incarnate, a telepresence performance between Melbourne and Hong Kong in March . His installation work MAP1 was exhibited at the CIRCUS conference in Glasgow in September 2001, and his work Codex was toured through the UK by the London based Random Dance Company in early 2001. He has been commissioned by the Melbourne International Festival to write a work for the Federation Bells, which will be launched at the 2001 festival. Paine has also exhibited responsive environment installations in 2001 in Melbourne, Sydney, and Hobart, and at the Australasian Computer Music Conference.<p>Paine was awarded the RMIT, New Media Arts fellowship by the Australia Council for the Arts for 2000. In recent years Garth's has become increasingly involved with the design of sound and interactive exhibitions in museums and galleries. These include the Melbourne Exhibition, the East Super Space and the Immigration Museum for the Museum of Victoria, the Australian Jewish Museum, the Performing Arts Museum, and the Eureka Stockade Centre.<p>Garth Paine is currently Lecturer in Music Technology with the Music, Technology and Innovation Research Group, Faculty of Humanities, De Montfort University, United Kingdom.
