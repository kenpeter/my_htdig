  5000 Calls is a large-scale multi-channel sound installation installed throughout the Urban Forest, an extensive 4.5 hectare loose grid of eucalyptus trees surrounding the Stadium Australia in Sydney. Commissioned by the Sydney Olympic Park Public Art Program to be part of the permanent built environment, it can be heard daily during daylight hours.<br> <br>The ever-changing soundscape utilises 5000 'charged' human vocalisations uncovered from everyday life: the sighs, gasps and groans of work, pleasure, sport, song and struggle. The 'sense' of speech has been removed from these everyday recordings to reveal a 'soundscape of human effort'. Our fascination lies in the non-speech aspects of voice, particularly in the vocalisations of people in extreme physical states. <p>The installation is designed as an ever-changing 'crowd system' where the many fragments of vocalisations are programmed to interact with each other in different ways, at different times. A customised delivery system is programmed to distribute sound in ever-changing ways to 80 loudspeakers mounted throughout the site. <p>NAWIC 2000 Arup Award for Achievement in Design <p>"Remarkable"<br>Philippe Régnier, The Art Newspaper No. 105, London, July 2000<p>"Public art too often devolves into compromised cliché as vested interests 'negotiate' the outcome. 5000 Calls survives this process and demonstrates a role for new media arts in this area."<br>Paul Brown, RealTime No. 36, Sydney, April 2000<p>"5000 Calls...comes as a complete surprise both in its functioning and in what it says about the inclusive possibilities for the creation of public art in highly visible venues... It utterly transgresses presumptions of the monumental generally associated with privileged outdoor sites... 5000 Calls literally haunts the site, blurring the delineation of public and private, presence and absence, celebration and distress."<br>Alex Gawronski, Real Time No. 40, Sydney, December 2000<p>"5000 Calls is at once the most evocative and evasive of all the works here."<br>Felicity Fenner, Art in America, May 2001<h4>Sources</h4>AUCTION / Cyclic appeals of auctioneers <p>BREATHING EQUIPMENT / Assisted breathing using aqualung, hospital respirator<p>CATTLE HERDING / Male and female stockmen / Central Queensland<p>CHILDBIRTH / Mothers' labour at the moment of birth<p>CHILD IN BATH / Imitating aeroplanes, cars and ships<p>DANCING / Tentative breathing while rehearsing a new work<p>DEAFBLIND SIGNING / Spontaneous vocalisations while communicating in sign language<p>DEFENCE FORCES / Parade calls, artillery drill, commando unit<p>DIGGING A WELL / Hollering calls of a work chant / Bangladesh<p>DOG OBEDIENCE SCHOOL / Short commands to animals;

It was important for us to capture each voice "close up" with as much proximity as possible. To achieve this we often used radio microphones which we attached to people involved in a wide a range of pursuits, such as athletes leaping high into the air during the high jump, soccer players weaving their way across a sports field or stroke patients at a rehabilitation hospital struggling as they re-learn how to walk.<p>We digitised these large chunks of location recordings, for the painstaking process of isolating the short expressive vocalisations that we were looking for - vocalisations which often occur in-between the words (gasps, sighs, different weights of breath) and the involuntary vocalisations made as a result of physical action. We used a number of techniques to then further refine these short moments, isolating the individual voices from the often noisy and complex acoustic environments of the original recordings. <p>It was important for us not to tamper with the original qualities of the voices for this is what makes them so compelling. We tried to remove only the extraneous sounds, to bring the listener right up close to the soundmakers, revealing an almost uncanny sense of clarity. <p>The core of the delivery system is a Pentium III with an external Hard Drive where each of the 5000 individual vocalisations is stored as an individual sound file. Selected sound files can be instantly accessed and sent to particular loudspeakers to form part of the combination of "crowd events" at any particular time. The system is programmed to firstly select and then deliver particular groups of sound to the 80 loudspeakers discreetly distributed through the 4.5 hectare site. To help achieve this, 24 individual channels of cabling - totalling some 5 km - were built into the site. <p>The system was designed in conjunction with Resonant Designs, the company involved in developing the specialist software. Krypton Audio Server [&copy; Isotope] allows complex programming of the order and distribution of sound files. This combines with AutoMate [&copy; Isotope] which allows programming of the delivery of the sound groups. Much of the programming occurred on site, where we made careful adjustments over several week-long periods while listening to our own developing real-time crowd of voices.
